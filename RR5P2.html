<h1>Why We Should Teach XML: An Argument for Technical Acuity (Summary)</h1>

<author>Becky Jo Gesteland McShane</author><br>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Private Industry versus Academia </paragraph_topic></paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>According to the author (Gesteland McShane), private industry is too focused on technology and academia is too focused on rhetoric while both sides should move to the middle. At the same time, the reason industry managers do not utilize technical writers to solve information technology issues within organizations is because technical writers do not have the expertise in business administration and information technology/computer science. So technical writers need to add new skillsets or be rendered obsolete, which is a consequence for failure to adapt to change. Plus, college English departments seem to be exclusively hiring leftist indoctrinated fools who discriminate against conservative faculty and students while private industry is outsourcing and offshoring technical writing away from leftist indoctrinated fools to those trained in other industries (who tend to be more conservative). The net effect is that each (private industry and academia) is undermining the other while academia fails to disclose this fact to students in order to fill seats and retain funding.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Rhetoric versus Reality</paragraph_topic></paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>According to Gesteland McShane, English professors should teach technology instead of industry because analyzing and critiquing technology is more important than utilizing technology. Also, the technical writing profession affords the opportunity to employ "the full range of our rhetorical skills." This is one of the reasons private industry is phasing out classically trained technical writers through outsourcing and offshoring and choosing to utilize professionals trained in other areas. Plus, English professors and technical writers steeped in ideology who lack technological proficiency are undermining their own profession by telling private industry what to do and how to think about what it does. Rhetoric is useless and inappropriate in the corporate environment in the context of CMS. And no, everything is not based in or structured to enforce racism and sexism (only CRT and leftist fools are).</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>XML Should be Allocated to the Computer Science Department</paragraph_topic></paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Gesteland McShane states that technical communicators should learn XML, DTDs, and DITA. That’s true, but XML elements are useless without JQuery, AJAX, JavaScript and SQL DBM and this class teaches none of those programs. If students want to find jobs that do not treat them as "automatons," then they should not be English majors because they will be relegated to glorified data entry operators in the context of CMS. One solution proposed by the author regarding the way English Departments teach writing and technology in the context of CMS is to separate content from presentation. This is specifically utilizing single sourcing, which is much more efficient writing that requires no classical training in technical writing. Technical writing in the context of CMS has been reduced to template form field data entry in the corporate environment. The author acknowledges that technical writing is moving away from craftsmanship of the entire document to incorporating other skillsets like information analysts, designers, architects and technologies that require business administration and computer science skillsets. But the author contradicts herself in the conclusion by stating that technical writing students should learn desktop publishing software, graphic design and illustration software, in addition to word processing software. No doubt this is to keep funding in college English departments when students would be better served by incorporating XML, JavaScript, and SQL DBM classes taught from the Computer Science Department.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>XML is an Upper Division Programming Language</paragraph_topic></paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Then Gesteland McShane had the audacity to state that XML is "not a programming language." Yes it is. XML is an upper division programming language with a lot of prerequisites. It is learned in conjunction with JavaScript and SQL DBM. That is why J.D. Applen (mentioned in Gesteland McShane's article) stated that XML is a programming language. One of these people knows what they are talking about. The author goes on to state that because technical writers write the content, structure the content, and know how to reuse the content, they should be the creators of single sourcing projects. I disagree. It takes strategy to comprehend and anticipate users in order to build the database and write the code to extract information products and reassemble them on the fly for consumers. This means that Business Administration, Information Technology, and Computer Science majors are better suited to CMS environments than traditionally trained technical writers. Contrary to the author’s statement that private industry is using "data management and computer programming skills to solve a rhetorical problem," English professors are out of their league when it comes to teaching XML and CMS. They do not have the expertise and are not qualified to teach these programming languages. Then Gesteland McShane goes on to state that "The literary skills of technical communicators parallel the technical skills of XML developers." Not even close. Computer science PhDs need to take over here and give these English PhDs a reality check. Whether this is ignorance or deception students are paying for it.</body></li></ul>
