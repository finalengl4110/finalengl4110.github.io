<h1>The Implications of Single Sourcing for Writers and Writing (Summary)</h1>

<li><body>Single sourcing increases companies’ efficiency, quality, flexibility, and revenue and cuts costs through content management systems. But single sourcing comes with technological innovation and changes technical writing in myriad ways. Employees might perceive this technological innovation as a radical change that threatens their livelihoods and traditions. Additionally, gaps exist between those who implement and administer new technologies and those who use them to perform their job functions. Carter argues that those who use these new technologies to perform their jobs should be included in the design and implementation of new technologies to provide balance between CMS designers and users. Including employees in decisions might decrease stress for employees as too intense or frequent changes do not allow time for employees to acclimate. According to Carter, "Excessive change may lead to initiative overload, organizational chaos, and resistance to change." Therefore, managers should introduce change incrementally. Managers should frequently disseminate the overall strategy and evolving values to employees in order to avoid the chaos and resistance inherent in change and to make employees feel like they’re part of the process and not being rejected in favor of new tech and so end up quitting their jobs.</body></li></ul>

<li><body>Desktop publishing software changed technical writing in the 1980s by increasing the scope of the job to include writing, graphic design, page layout, and publishing. However, single sourcing could decrease the scope of technical writing to only creating content with no presentation involvement. Technological innovation could also eliminate the need for technical writers altogether. Then again, maybe the market will move in the other direction and expand the technical writing profession. According to Carter, technical writers could have "an expanded or consolidated role, one that requires the further integration of skills to include management and technology specialists," but this is entirely speculation as the market drives business decisions. If the market does lean towards consolidation and integration of skillsets for technical writers, colleges must change their approach to teaching technical writing. Technical writing degrees should integrate aspects of business administration and computer science with a much more thorough knowledge of CMS and structured writing.</body></li></ul>
