<h1>Content Management and the Separation of Presentation and Content (Summary)</h1>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Benefits of Separation of Content and Presentation</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Advocates for the separation of content (text) and presentation (formatting) argue that these two elements of documents should be stored separately to facilitate independent editing of both. For example, the use of cascading style sheets in Web design means that all formatting elements of a Webpage are stored in the CSS. When a change needs to be made to a Website’s background color for every page that change only needs to be made in the CSS instead of in every single page individually. Changing elements in the CSS does not alter content (text). Additionally, if a change needs to be made to content, the Web designer only needs to change the text within a tagged element of an XML document for the change to cascade across Webpages without having to make those changes page-by-page. Not only is this process much more efficient for making changes to text and presentation, but it allows for reuse and repurposing of content as long as it’s properly tagged and stored. According to Clark, "technologies that separate content from presentation may allow for better rhetorical design, because they will expedite the production of multiple effective designs of the same content for different audiences and purposes, a move that is otherwise too impractical and costly."</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Impact of Content Management Systems on Technical Writers.</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>The planning phase of content management must be strategically aligned across all departments to meet dynamic publishing needs and to maintain accessibility and organizational consistency. This can be problematic for technical writers trained to combine content and presentation who believe that combining these two elements is a must for a document to be rhetorically effective. Times have changed and technical writers should learn to compartmentalize their writing within a content management system (CMS). In the end, a well-designed CMS reunites content and presentation and is just as rhetorically effective as traditional static documents of imparting a message, but with the added element of rearrangement via dynamic publishing to suit consumers’ needs instead of just the writer’s needs. . Separating content and presentation may be hard for writers to comprehend because they’ve been trained to think of content and presentation as being tightly linked. However, static documents are obsolete in business these days and to stay relevant, writers must integrate new mindsets and skillsets. Technical writers should acquire more education in order to understand the concepts and technologies involved in the design and implementation of content management systems in business and incorporate themselves into those decisions.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Web CMS Versus Document CMS</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>The two types of CMS are Web CMS and document CMS and both typically work together to form Websites where information is searchable and retrievable and assembled uniquely according to consumer needs. Both types of CMSs are devoted to the separation of content and presentation. A document CMS is a database that automates dynamic publishing through defined standards in XML that label each chunk of text with tags or metadata to describe its meaning and relationship to other content that is then assembled on the fly in different contexts, presentations, and media. Web designers will understand and implement this concept a lot easier than writers because Web design involves writing code for the information to be displayed in a browser (usually retrievable from a database) and attaching an independently created CSS for all presentation functions</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>How Content is Separated from Presentation in HTML and XML</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Instead of producing static documents, content is written and stored in chunks defined by XML tags at section, paragraphs, sentence, or word levels. This means that these chunks of text can then be reassembled on the fly in myriad ways and contexts according to consumer searches. Presentation is how that information is displayed or how its output structure is viewed by the consumer once assembled. In Web design, CSS has become the standard with W3C beginning to eliminate presentation specific content such as <font> tags at the browser level. However, like XML, Web CMS must also tag all content with "div" or "p" tags etc., in chunks so that content displays properly (and doesn’t display as one long line of text that spans for pages). Content within these tags can be formatted in the HTML code of a Webpage directly, but it’s better to attach a CSS so that changes to tags can be made in one place and cascade to all Webpages. Separating content from presentation means easier, automated maintenance of both through XML and CSS that generates consistency in company branding and customer information output. This means that companies must standardize and enforce presentation since quality is most often defined by consistency.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>How Content is Tagged and Stored in XML</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Content is written and stored in chunks and tagged in XML with descriptions of its subject, genre, definition, etc. XML tags define only the content, not appearance or formatting elements (e.g., styles). For example, a warning tag might look like this: <legal_warning_toasters_all>Do not stick a fork in the toaster.</legal_warning_toasters_all>. This tag was constructed at the sentence level and is relevant to the subject of the sentence with both an opening and closing tag. Writing within a CMS follows schemas that define relationships with other content modules produced within an organization. The content modules can produce output in any combination of categories and formats automatically. Since output is dynamically assembled on the fly, "CMS content must be written to be automatically appropriate for several kinds of documents, regardless of genre or medium."</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Affordances of Separation</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Affordances of separation affect businesses decisions. This includes known affordances like "cost reduction, expediency, interdepartmental reuse, and the improvement of quality and these become the clearest, most necessary affordances" of CMS purchases, but also unforeseen effects like being too costly to maintain and not functioning as intended or being trapped in a contract with a single vendor. Affordances of separation reduce complexity by using variables. Using variables when tagging content for reuse is easier when individual words are the only changing element within content in order to reduce complexity when managing content. Affordances of separation create genres. Genres of information just mean categories of information. According to Clark, "to construct the characteristics of a genre, the most likely candidates for inclusion are technical manuals, product sheets, quick reference cards, etc. [Focus on] end-user oriented genres rather than internal documentation and correspondence." Depending on the situation, writers will produce chunks of text with tags for each element or write genre neutral content.</body></li></ul>
