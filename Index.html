<h1>Rhetorical Work in the Age of Content Management (Summary)</h1>

<author>Rebekka Andersen</author><br>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Content Management Issues Affecting Technical Writing</paragraph_topic></paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Technical writing is being standardized into a production system much like manufacturing where workers focus on components of the finished product but never build the product in its entirety from beginning to end. Instead, technical writing creates a finished information product that is a component of the whole following XML authoring rules established by the content management system (CMS). This standardization gives content writers no control over their writing. Writers do not make decisions regarding audience or where, why and how material is published because writers must follow predetermined standards embedded within XML authoring programs so that seamless integration of the work of many writers can be accomplished. CM is a system of writing reuse.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Purpose of Content Management</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Those who design the CMS decide how content is written, structured, formatted, displayed and tagged. That information becomes part of a database where information is retrievable in dynamic publishing, which means that all parts can be reassembled in any order on-demand. The formal definition for this content is intelligent content. Intelligent content is ‘‘content that can be managed efficiently and dynamically delivered to an unlimited range of targets using high-precision automation.’’ Intelligent content is ‘‘not limited to one purpose, technology, or output.’’ Intelligent content is consumer focused and consumer driven content.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Content Management Output and Efficiency</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Consumers want small chunks of context relevant information that they can view on portable devices like smartphones anywhere and anytime. Traditional static documents of technical writers do not facilitate on-demand dynamic publishing. Therefore, technical writers should learn to think in terms of brand building with customer focus, content customization, and convergence of company-wide information to safeguard from conflicting information coming from different departments. But it’s also cost effective when the company does not have to pay for several content management systems for various departments. It also improves the image of the company because different departments are not producing contradictory content that would have a negative impact on the company brand from a customer perspective.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Content Management Consequences for Technical Writing</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Technical writers no longer need to understand rhetorical devices and relationships and only need to follow the rules stipulated in XML authoring software to produce consistent, well-structured reusable content. The result is that rhetorical work is simplified within a production environment. However, technical writers resist the production environment being applied to rhetorical work. This results in topic-based inconsistencies because many writers within an organization aren’t following the same rules. Therefore, enforcement of compliance of rules inherent in XML authoring is paramount. Another issue arising from the production environment is that XML authoring tools means that those who are not trained writers can produce well-structured content. Trained technical writers are no longer needed because their craft adds no value to the business. This is why many companies have eliminated full-time technical writing positions and the reason technical writers’ jobs are being outsourced and offshored to reduce labor costs.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Solution to Technical Writer Obsolescence</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Develop new competencies. According to the author, in order to ensure that technical writing is not relegated to obsolescence, writers should incorporate other skillsets into their knowledge base including abstraction, experimentation, collaboration, and system thinking. This is symbolic analytic work defined and means going back to college to learn business administration, information technology, finance, or systems analysis, etc. This is high-level analytical thinking beyond the scope of traditional technical writing and adds value to industry through facilitating and engaging in content management systems design and management. Technical writers need to know how to develop content and processes that encompass all departments within an organization, which requires strategic thinking to build the CM framework. Therefore, technical writers must acquire a broad range of skills to stay relevant in industry.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Necessary Skillsets for Technical Writers</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Technical writers need skills in abstraction to discern patterns, relationships, and hierarchies in large masses of information. Technical writers need systems design skills to discern larger causes, consequences and relationships in order to solve problems. Technical writers need experimentation skills to form and test hypothesis about information and communication." Technical writers need collaboration skills to share knowledge, ideas, problems, and solutions in an effort to reach consensus on the best plan to implement. In summary, technical writers must become analysts, architects, and strategists in a vastly expanded rhetorical situation.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Reality of Technical Writing in Academia versus Industry</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>The reality is that today’s college technical writing programs do not adequately address the skillsets and strategic mindset needed for content management and private industry environments. It may be due to a lack of incentive for public higher education institutions to change since they are taxpayer funded whereas private industry must be as efficient and cost effective as possible to stay competitive. In other words, private industry constantly innovates while acedemia stagnates. Academia is out of touch with the realities in private industry and not effectively preparing students for the workforce. Reasons listed here (among others) are likely why academia and industry veer away from collaboration to solve these problems. That, or private industry already solved these problems without academia's input. Maybe it's a matter of perspective.</body></li></ul>
