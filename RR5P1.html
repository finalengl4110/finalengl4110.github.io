<h1>Writing in the Workplace: Constructing Documents Using Multiple Digital Sources (Summary)</h1>

<Authors>Hayes, Leijten, Schriver, and Van Waes</Authors><br>

<date>2014</date><br><br>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Proposal Inception</paragraph_topic></paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>This article follows a technical writer, Aiden, employed at Nova (pseudonym). Nova’s employees come from computer science, communications, economics, language, and history backgrounds. Aiden is a project manager with a background in business management and economics. Aiden is not formally trained in technical writing. However, Aiden has acquired skill in producing proposals (that win bids/contracts). This particular project follows the creation of a proposal that is a response to a RFP from the Flemish Government for implementation of a content management system (CMS) focused on taxes and scholarships. This CMS requires the development of new and consolidation of existing government databases spread out over multiple systems. The authors followed Aiden around to observe his work physically, with keystroke loggers, and conducted interviews with him periodically.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Document Reuse, Adaptation, and Content Assembly</paragraph_topic></paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>The writing process took only 8.5 hours for one proposal with a total of 55,000 lines of data. Most of it was assembled from other sources and modified to be relevant to this project and client. During the writing process, Aiden searched extensively through online sources for ideas and constructed the outline for the proposal from previous proposals he’s written. This action is indicative of the document reuse and adaptation that the authors claim pervades technical writing. It’s really content assembly from other sources. According to the authors, professional writing involves strategic integrating, sampling, and recontextualizing of source materials. However, texts are not so much written as assembled. Professional writers distill best practices (industry or company) to create something new (unless writers are primary sources--experts in their respective fields). Supposedly, these assembled texts create a "transformation of knowledge" that differentiates college students from professionals in the private sector. But knowledge transformation means that writers have experience to draw from and are not just stringing together a pastiche of other peoples’ ideas. However, when it comes to graphics, Aiden searches the company’s databases to find charts, spreadsheets, and photos that already exist from other projects. Aiden did not create unique graphics for this proposal himself so the graphics seem somewhat generic.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Planning, Coordinating, Writing, Designing, and Evaluating in Corporate versus Small Business Environments</paragraph_topic></paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>The authors go on to state that "Textual coordination is accessing many types of documents and software programs that mediate their activity that both constrains and fosters their perception." However, if technical writers are working from a RFP, the RFP stipulates proposal parameters in detail such as design and content. This small business is not indicative of global corporate technical writing practices. Since I used to do this for a living, in a global corporation, the department manager reads through the RFP and creates the project management schedule and deadlines. The actual writing is delegated to individual writers in segments by the project manager. Nobody writes an entire proposal from beginning to end. The Visual Basic programmer creates the template of styles to be attached to the document. The graphics team creates original graphics with a digital camera, Photoshop, and Illustrator. The word processing team assembles all parts, proofreads and formats the proposal, and prints and binds the hardcopies. Everybody, including the corporate partner assigned to the project, the department manager, the project manager, the graphics team, the writers, and the word processing team participates in the page-turn for every single hard copy in order to find errors before shipping to the client. For large corporations, these are the planning, coordinating, writing, designing, and evaluating phases of the project. Everybody works together performing different tasks to accomplish a single goal. This encompasses the ability to negotiate the workplace environment and culture. So the process of setting goals, selecting strategy, searching for information, carrying out procedures and reflecting on the process is very different in small businesses environments versus global corporate environments.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Contextualizing, Connecting, Structuring and Formulating in Corporate versus Small Business Environments</paragraph_topic></paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>While Aiden used boilerplate text from previous proposals and modified it, and he used the company’s Wiki site and PDF docs for his graphics content in a small business environment, original content is often created from scratch in corporate environments. Aiden created his own knowledge repository for future projects for mining and reuse in later projects. His graphics came from prefabricated sources and were not original. Additionally, Aiden read the RFP himself a few times (which is inefficient). Aiden generated his own project management file in Excel (also inefficient--these tasks should be delegated to the project manager). Aiden created the proposal himself and it only took 8.5 hours whereas in large corporations teams are assembled to carry out compartmentalized tasks that can take months to complete if the final proposal is a few hundred pages long with complex spreadsheets and flowcharts. The tactics and strategies for contextualizing content, connecting content to client needs, structuring and formulating text, and designing layout and visuals are very different in small business and corporate environments. But the authors claim that the writing activities observed are "quite typical." No, they are not. Not even close. Observing one environment and claiming that it’s typical of every writing environment is not factual.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Control, Process, and Resource Levels</paragraph_topic></paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>According to the authors, the writing process has three levels--the control level, the process level, and the resource level. The control level involves motivation and structures that control the other writing processes like planning and executing the writing process. The process level has two parts: the writing processes and the task environment. The writing processes are the internal mechanisms of the writer and the task environment includes the physical, social, technology and cultural environment of the company. The resource level includes resources that involve the writing process but also the technology and environment utilized by the writer.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Fragmented and Chaotic</paragraph_topic></paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>The authors used and adapted the Hayes’ model to describe the activities they observed in this single case study of a very small business where one employee creates the entire proposal himself. The authors added three processes to Hayes’ model: searching for information, constructing graphics, and motivation management. The authors also incorporated Schriver’s description of professional communication, which includes constructing, connecting, and contextualizing content. Aiden engaged in all these activities, but it’s not the same in every professional environment. The authors go on to state that the "construction process appeared fragmented and even chaotic," but "was highly goal driven." Aiden had a deadline to meet, so he distributed his time across different tasks to meet the deadline. But the process itself is more efficient in a corporate environment where tasks are delegated to teams with focus and expertise in specific aspects of proposal creation.</body></li></ul>
