<h1>The Impact of Single Sourcing and Technology (Summary)</h1>

<ul>

<li><body>Desktop publishing became prevalent in the 1980s with PageMaker, Quark, and Publisher. Writers had to add computer applications to their writing skills to be employable. This shifted focus for writers from task and audience analysis and communication to technology. This shift meant that writers spent most of their time creating and updating static electronic documents. The move from hard copies to electronic copies meant disseminating large amounts of information faster and with greater accuracy since materials could be easily updated. It meant that research became easier with online archives of printed material (scanned PDFs).</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Four Stages of Development for Information Technology</paragraph_topic></h2></span><ul>
<li><body>To date, technological innovations have affected technical writing in four ways. These include:<br><br>
<li>(1) Identical content for multiple media output: These materials are static hard copies converted into PDFs and archived into a database for retrieval. Technical writers also create context sensitive help features using the text from the paper hard copies of a user’s manual. For single sourced content, there was no customization of content. There is no differentiation in materials between media and usage. Users get the same static help features no matter the platform. Customization to accommodate different media and users’ needs meant that material was changed and was single sourced.</li>
<li>(2) Static customized content: This material is still static yet single source to include common content and customized content. The customized content is built for specific user needs and output and includes multimedia output, multiple platform output, product families, multiple audiences, and multiple releases.</li>
<li>(3) Dynamic customized content: Technical communications has moved away from traditional static documents to object oriented information. This means that writers create chunks of information to be extracted, presented, and reused on-the-fly depending on users’ needs. This kind of writing utilizes XML and is structured for consistency according to rules set forth in the CMS. Technical writes must write with reuse in mind and tag information products accordingly. This information is accessed in three ways: through user profiles, user selection (preferences), or through user profiles, selection and personalization. E-commerce is the impetus for this change in business. This becomes object oriented information that uses portals, databases, metadata, and customer profiles.</li>
<li>(4) Electronic performance support system (EPSS): This level of information pertains only to definable uses with detailed profiles and provides just-in-time (JIT) information based on users’ profiles and preferences. This system learns from users’ habits and is driven by e-commerce. Levels 3 and 4 are object oriented information products that change technical communicators’ roles entirely.</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>How Single Sourcing is Changing Technical Communications</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Traditional static documents are no longer useful. Now writers write blocks of text that are tagged and stored in an XML database to be retrieved on-the-fly by users. This requires a team approach with some writers writing core information products and others writing peripheral information products that are differing and customized for specific users or groups. In this environment, writers focus exclusively on content and not presentation in single sourced writing. The author (Rockley) contends that instead of narrowing the scope of the technical writing profession, single sourcing and CMS broaden the scope since a multitude of complementary skillsets are incorporated into technical writing and are involved in implementing strategy. Single sourcing also means that writers don’t have to waste time updating content in several different areas. Updating content is done in one place and cascades everywhere that information is used. Instead, writers concentrate on creating new content to meet users’ needs. E-commerce is the driving force behind these changes made to the technical writing profession. Companies like Amazon, EBay, Netflix and i-Tunes have shifted markets to online venues. These retail changes are accompanied by e-publishing and online information products. Currently, technical communications has shifted from writing static documents to designing information architecture. Information architecture "involves analyzing information to determine current and required structures and building models that identify information product models, elements, and reusable components."</body></li></ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Technical Writers Become Information Technologists</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Traditionally writers created the content with presentation as one unit of information and then published it. Single sourcing eliminates presentation from content so that writers concentrate on information and strategize the use of that information to meet users’ needs. This requires knowledge of CMS, business administration, and computer science. E-commerce is the driving force and is driven by consumer behavior and profiles, which constitutes today’s market. According to the author, "The success of dynamic documentation is dependent on the information models, metadata, and configuration of the underlying database, all components controlled by information developers." In summary, the technical writing profession is being transformed into an information technologist profession.</body></li></ul>
