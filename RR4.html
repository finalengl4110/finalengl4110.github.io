<h1>Work Motivation in the Rhetoric of Component Content Management (Summarized)</h1>
<author>By Tatiana Batova</author><br>

<ul>

<li><body>Component content management (CCM) focuses on efficiency and cost effectiveness. CCM involves the creation of text in small chunks instead of long static documents that can be reassembled and reused on-demand by consumers of these information products. Due to lack of analysis, planning, organization readiness and a change management plan, CCM systems sometimes fail during implementation. Some employees resist the implementation of CCM systems due to "lack of buy-in" and increased workloads of having to learn CCM systems on top of their regular job duties. This can be attributed to employees’ fear of change and companies’ cultural dynamics, but it also has a lot to do with attitudes and skillsets as demonstrated by results of this case study. The author (Tatiana Batova) argues that focusing on efficiency and cost effectiveness in the context of CCM is sometimes detrimental to technical communicators because their motivation decreases when they don’t see results of their work or get recognition for it. Additionally, CCM technologizes and streamlines processes that should be complex and rhetorical thereby devaluing TC. Technical writing is neither cost effective nor efficient in comparison to a CCM environment, which is consumer driven, so a shift in perspective is needed. Plus, Batova ultimately refutes her own argument in her case study as one marketing employee and one computer science employee flourished in the CCM environment whereas the traditionally trained technical communicator did not. CCM has the potential to increase the complexity of technical communications through job crafting, which involves understanding motivational factors for employees.</body></li>

<li><body>This article focuses on finding strategies that "counteract resistance and lack of buy-ins" in order to "understand the work motivation of technical communicators" who must learn to integrate CCM systems into their daily routine to benefit internal and external consumers. Understanding two factors is important for offsetting internal resistance to CCM systems. These factors include reconfiguring the meaning of work in the context of CCM (job crafting), and interacting with and maintaining relationships with internal and external consumers of information products (prosocial motivation). In the context of CCM, the emphasis has shifted away from traditional technical writing that focused on the preferences of writers towards preferences of consumers. While management should be a source of motivation for the transition to CCM systems, it shouldn’t be the only source of motivation (due to the babysitting factor). Technical communicators should engage in job crafting to motivate themselves and align their values to those of the organization through CCM systems.</body></li>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Work Motivation & Prosocial Motivation</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Understanding work motivation is important for organizations because work quality diminishes with unmotivated employees whereas the opposite is true for motivated employees. Extrinsic and intrinsic are the two types of motivation available to employees. Intrinsic motivation means that employees invent or redefine meaning and purpose in their work and align their values accordingly. External motivation is when employees are doing the job for money, public recognition, or power. Of the two, intrinsic motivation is the most desirable. Employees who find their work purposeful inspire other employees  as well, which contributes to organization cohesiveness. Employees must see the fruits of their labor to make them more engaged and productive and they must receive recognition for their work. In contrast, lack of recognition "leads to loss of meaning, which in turn leads to decreased work motivation." Receiving recognition for work involves prosocial motivation. Prosocial motivation focuses on how to use consumer feedback to motivate employees. Prosocial motivation means that employees engage with end consumers of their information products to elicit feedback and provide better service. This in turn inspires greater intrinsic motivation to find solutions to problems that benefit consumers. Employees who engage in job crafting incorporate prosocial motivation and receive greater overall job satisfaction.</body></li>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Job Crafting</paragraph_topic></h2></span>
<ul>

<li><body>Three types of job crafting exist: task crafting (redefining the job), relational crafting (incorporating consumer relationships), and cognitive crafting (changing perspective on meaning and purpose of the job). The case study followed three employees: one from marketing, one from I.T., and one technical writer. Two employees engaged in job crafting and one did not. The end result of the case study is that the two employees (marketing and I.T.) who engaged in job crafting expanded the scope of their jobs and consumer networks while the employee (technical writer) who did not engage in job crafting, diminished the scope of her job and consumer networks. The positive feedback the two job crafting employees received from consumers reinforced their value in the company, which increased their motivation.</body></li>
</ul>

<li><span><h2><paragraph_topic>Attitude and Willingness to Learn</paragraph_topic></h2><span>
<ul>

<li><body>Ultimately, this case study is all about employee attitude and willingness to learn. While this article only includes one case study in a single corporate cultural environment, it reveals that it is possible to create favorable contexts for job crafting in CCM environments by understanding what motivates employees. The two employees who engaged in job crafting came from backgrounds (marketing and computer science) with no formal technical writing training and flourished in a CCM environment whereas the traditionally trained technical writer became resentful about the CCM system enough to actually shun it. While this article states that educators need to emphasize job crafting, problem solving, identifying stakeholders and resources, and aligning skillsets and values with business and consumer goals, it actually made the case for hiring employees with business and computer science backgrounds instead of traditional technical writing backgrounds.</body></li></ul>
